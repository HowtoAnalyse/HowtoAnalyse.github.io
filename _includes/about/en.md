> Yet another lady.


Hi, I am *@sara* (Sara, Z.), a data analyst with 1-year experience on recommender systems and natural language processing.

My restuarant recommender system project have been implemented into production. I'm sure millions of users from Hong Kong and Tai Wan will benefit from it. 

Meanwhile, I actively apply machine learning techniques into Kaggle competitions to obtain a more thorough understanding on algorithms. 

Before starting my career, I worked in a research lab focusing on clinical trials after BSc in Chemical Technology from [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk)

I love talking about data science. So never hesitate to shoot me an InMail on linkedin if you have questions.
