Finally I decided to leave my current company. Let me use S instead of the company name.

The reason why I hesitate to leave is that S has been offering a great platform for me to gain practical experience on big data solutions and I have learned a lot. So I want to stay at S and make it better with my sincere gratitude.

The reason why I finally handed in my resignation letter is -- money.

S is lucky to have so many users. But S doesn’t cherish them. “Users are tools to make money.” In S, that’s all about the definition of users.

I have used up my passion on building recommendation systems for S, without rewards to refill me. After setting up recommender systems comes a money-driven requirement -- to insert sponsor items into users’ lists, without notifying them. no matter they like it or not.

I refuse to do so. And here is the result -- database access has been limited; piles of chores like settling network issues are waiting for me every day at work to keep me away from data projects.

So I’m eager to find a place where I have more freedom on data analysis. Making positive contribution to the society is all I want.

Wish us a better society.

From Sara with love.
