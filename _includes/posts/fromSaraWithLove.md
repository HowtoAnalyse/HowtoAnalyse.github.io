I have a story of a girl. Her name is Sara.

Finally Sara decided to leave her current company. Let me use S instead of the company name.

She hesitated for a long time. 

S has been offering a great platform for her to gain practical experience on big data solutions and she has learned a lot. So she wants to stay at S and make it better with her sincerest gratitude.

The reason why she finally handed in her resignation letter is -- money.

S is lucky to have so many users. But S doesn’t cherish them. “Users are tools to make money.” In S, that’s all about the definition of users.

Sara has used up her passion on building recommendation systems for S, without rewards to refill her. After setting up recommender systems comes a money-driven requirement -- to insert sponsor items into users’ lists, without notifying them. no matter they like it or not.

She refuses to do so. And here is the result -- database access has been limited; piles of chores like settling network issues are waiting for her every day at work to keep her away from data projects.

She's now eager to find a place where she has more freedom on data analysis. Making positive contribution to the society is all she wants.

Wish us a better society.

From Sara with love.
