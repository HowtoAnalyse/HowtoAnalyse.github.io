I'm a data analyst passionate about recommender systems. Machine learning algorithms are used to define target group, demand forecast, item recommendation in my projects. Before I started my career, I worked in a research lab focusing on clinical trials after BSc in Chemical Technology from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

I believe data science is domain knowledge powered by computer science. I'm always interested in having a conversation for exciting project ideas. So never hesitate to connect me on linkedin if you have questions.

Due to my education background, it's easier for me to explain statistical findings to my colleagues from product and marketing team.
