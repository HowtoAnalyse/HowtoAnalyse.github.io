What does it look like (datatype and values), what makes it tick (independent/feature variables(s)), what's its goals in life (dependent/target variable(s)). Think of it like a first date, before you jump in and start poking it in the bedroom.\n",

All other variables are potential predictor or independent variables. **It's important to note, more predictor variables do not make a better model, but the right variables.**\n",
    "2. The *PassengerID* and *Ticket* variables are assumed to be random unique identifiers, that have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, they will be excluded from analysis.\n",
    "3. The *Pclass* variable is an ordinal datatype for the ticket class, a proxy for socio-economic status (SES), representing 1 = upper class, 2 = middle class, and 3 = lower class.\n",
    "4. The *Name* variable is a nominal datatype. It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title, family size from surname, and SES from titles like doctor or master. Since these variables already exist, we'll make use of it to see if title, like master, makes a difference.\n",
    "5. The *Sex* and *Embarked* variables are a nominal datatype. They will be converted to dummy variables for mathematical calculations.\n",
    "6. The *Age* and *Fare* variable are continuous quantitative datatypes.\n",
    "7. The *SibSp* represents number of related siblings/spouse aboard and *Parch* represents number of related parents/children aboard. Both are discrete quantitative datatypes. This can be used for feature engineering to create a family size and is alone variable.\n",
    "8. The *Cabin* variable is a nominal datatype that can be used in feature engineering for approximate position on ship when the incident occurred and SES from deck levels. However, since there are many null values, it does not add value and thus is excluded from analysis."

    "## 3.21 The 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting\n",
    "<a id=\"ch5\"></a>\n",
    "In this stage, we will clean our data by 1) correcting aberrant values and outliers, 2) completing missing information, 3) creating new features for analysis, and 4) converting fields to the correct format for calculations and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correcting:** Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs. In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be necessary to create an accurate model.\n",
    "2. **Completing:** There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and embarked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how-to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values. Thus, it's important to fix before we start modeling, because we will compare and contrast several models. There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it truly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria; like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. There are more complex methodologies, however before deploying, it should be compared to the base model to determine if complexity truly adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed with the median, the cabin attribute will be dropped, and embark will be imputed with mode. Subsequent model iterations may modify this decision to determine if it improves the model’s accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Creating:**  Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a title feature to determine if it played a role in survival.\n",
    "4. **Converting:** Last, but certainly not least, we'll deal with formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. For this dataset, we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables."

    "As mentioned previously, the test file provided is really validation data for competition submission. So, we will use *sklearn* function to split the training data in two datasets; 75/25 split. This is important, so we don't [overfit our model](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/lecture/fVStr/overfitting-and-underfitting). Meaning, the algorithm is so specific to a given subset, it cannot accurately generalize another subset, from the same dataset. It's important our algorithm has not seen the subset we will use to test, so it doesn't \"cheat\" by memorizing the answers. We will use [*sklearn's* train_test_split function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html). In later sections we will also use [*sklearn's* cross validation functions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation), that splits our dataset into train and test for data modeling."
