Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to create intelligent agents. Most tasks that require intelligence require an ability to induce new knowledge from experiences. Thus, a large area within AI is machine learning. Procedures in machine learning include ideas derived directly from, or inspired by, classical statistics, but they don't have to be. Data mining is an area that has taken much of its inspiration and techniques from machine learning (and some, also, from statistics), but aims at either to discover / generate some preliminary insights in an area where there really was little knowledge beforehand, or to be able to predict future observations accurately. 


There are considerable overlaps among them. If we have to make some distinctions, they are:


Statistics is about **numbers**. It is mostly employed towards better understanding particular data generating processes. Thus, it usually starts with a formally specified model, and from this are derived procedures to accurately extract that model from noisy instances (i.e., estimation--by optimizing some loss function) and to be able to distinguish it from other possibilities (i.e., inferences based on known properties of sampling distributions). The prototypical statistical technique is regression.


Data Mining is about using Statistics as well as other programming methods to find **patterns** hidden in the data so that you can explain some phenomenon. Data Mining builds intuition about what is really happening in some data and is still little more towards math than programming, but uses both. Common data mining techniques would include cluster analyses, classification and regression trees, and neural networks.


Machine Learning uses Data Mining techniques and other learning algorithms to build models of what is happening behind some data so that it can predict future outcomes. Math is the basis for many of the algorithms, but this is more towards programming. A computer program is said to learn some task from experience if its performance at the task improves with experience, according to some performance measure. Machine learning involves the study of algorithms that can extract information automatically (i.e., without on-line human guidance). 


Artificial Intelligence uses models built by Machine Learning and other ways to reason about the world and give rise to intelligent behavior whether this is playing a game or driving a robot/car. Artificial Intelligence has some goal to achieve by predicting how actions will affect the model of the world and chooses the actions that will best achieve that goal. Very programming based.
