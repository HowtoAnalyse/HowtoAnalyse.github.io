I visit [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) frequently in order to stay on top of news in my areas of interest. It will be much more efficient if I can design and automate a process to generate weekly digests of my most visited subreddits.

Following are the most voted Reddit posts I scraped on subreddits:

* datascience
* python
* programming
* machinelearning

Enjoy!
