As a data analyst, I'm always looking for ways to leverage massive dataset to automate customer-facing experiences. Recently I'm focusing on using word2vec to power a recommendation engine.

Following is a minimalist script explaining how to apply Word2Vec for item recommendation and the data science behind it. 

The demo data can be downloaded here: https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k

## Step 1. Make every user's to-read list as a sentence and feed it into word2vec

Given a dataset large enough, it can find out similar books


```python
import collections
import math
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
from six.moves import xrange
```

It's worth mentioning that the syntax of `xrange` and `range` are the same.

* xrange(stop)
* xrange(start, stop[, step])

The major difference is that `range` outputs tuples while `xrange` gives us a generator, which is more efficient when data are too large to fit in memory.


```python
tr = pd.read_csv( 'to_read.csv' )
b = pd.read_csv( 'books.csv' )
bt = tr.merge( b[[ 'book_id', 'title']], on = 'book_id' )
```


```python
bt.sample(10)
```

Detailed exploration and data cleaning process -> 


```python
raw = bt.groupby('user_id')['title'].apply(list)
assert len(raw)==tr.user_id.nunique()
```


```python
words = [b for books in raw.values for b in books]
n_words = bt.title.nunique()
print("There are {} books and {} to-read records".format(n_words,len(words)))
```

    There are 9951 books and 912705 to-read records



```python
def build_dataset(words, n_words):
    count = []
    count.extend(collections.Counter(words).most_common(n_words))
    dictionary = dict()
    for word, _ in count:
        dictionary[word] = len(dictionary)
    data = list()
    for word in words:
        index = dictionary.get(word, 0)
        data.append(index)
    reversed_dictionary = dict(zip(dictionary.values(), dictionary.keys()))
    return data, count, dictionary, reversed_dictionary


```


```python
data, count, dictionary, reverse_dictionary = build_dataset(words,n_words)
```


```python
words[0]
```

## Step 2. Build a skip-gram model

We can create our own word embeddings easily using `gensim`, an open source Python library focusing on topic modeling.

Here I will have a try on `TensorFlow`. 


```python
data_index = 0

def generate_batch(batch_size, num_skips, skip_window):
    global data_index
    assert batch_size % num_skips == 0
    assert num_skips <= 2*skip_window
    batch = np.ndarray(shape=(batch_size), dtype=np.int32)
    labels = np.ndarray(shape=(batch_size, 1), dtype=np.int32)
    span = 2 * skip_window + 1  # [ skip_window target skip_window ]
    buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=span)
    if data_index + span > len(data):
        data_index = 0
    buffer.extend(data[data_index:data_index + span])
    data_index += span
    for i in range(batch_size // num_skips):
        context_words = [w for w in range(span) if w != skip_window]
        words_to_use = random.sample(context_words, num_skips)
        for j, context_word in enumerate(words_to_use):
            batch[i * num_skips + j] = buffer[skip_window]
            labels[i * num_skips + j, 0] = buffer[context_word]
        if data_index == len(data):
            for book in data[:span]:
                buffer.append(book)
            data_index = span
        else:
            buffer.append(data[data_index])
            data_index += 1
  # Backtrack a little bit to avoid skipping words in the end of a batch
    data_index = (data_index + len(data) - span) % len(data)
    return batch, labels

batch, labels = generate_batch(batch_size=8, num_skips=2, skip_window=1)
for i in range(8):
  print(batch[i], reverse_dictionary[batch[i]],
        '->', labels[i, 0], reverse_dictionary[labels[i, 0]])


```

num_skips = 2         # How many times to reuse an input to generate a label.
num_sampled = 64      # Number of negative examples to sample.

# We pick a random validation set to sample nearest neighbors. Here we limit the
# validation samples to the words that have a low numeric ID, which by
# construction are also the most frequent. These 3 variables are used only for
# displaying model accuracy, they don't affect calculation.
valid_size = 16     # Random set of words to evaluate similarity on.

    # Add variable initializer.
    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()


```

## Step 3. Start Training


```python
num_steps = 100001

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:
    # We must initialize all variables before we use them.
    init.run()
    print('Initialized')

    average_loss = 0
    for step in xrange(num_steps):
        batch_inputs, batch_labels = generate_batch(
            batch_size, num_skips, skip_window)
        feed_dict = {train_inputs: batch_inputs, train_labels: batch_labels}

        # We perform one update step by evaluating the optimizer op (including it
        # in the list of returned values for session.run()
        _, loss_val = session.run([optimizer, loss], feed_dict=feed_dict)
        average_loss += loss_val

        if step % 2000 == 0:
            if step > 0:
                average_loss /= 2000
          # The average loss is an estimate of the loss over the last 2000 batches.
            print('Average loss at step ', step, ': ', average_loss)
            average_loss = 0

    # Note that this is expensive (~20% slowdown if computed every 500 steps)
        if step % 10000 == 0:
            sim = similarity.eval()
            for i in xrange(valid_size):
                valid_word = reverse_dictionary[valid_examples[i]]
                top_k = 3  # number of nearest neighbors
                nearest = (-sim[i, :]).argsort()[1:top_k + 1]
                log_str = 'Nearest to %s:' % valid_word
                for k in xrange(top_k):
                    close_word = reverse_dictionary[nearest[k]]
