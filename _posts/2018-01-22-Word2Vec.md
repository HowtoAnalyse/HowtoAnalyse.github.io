title: From Word2Vec to Item Recommendation
description: Recommendation System Powered by Word2Vec

As a data analyst, I'm always looking for ways to leverage massive data set to automate customer-facing experiences.

Following is a minimalist script explaining how to apply Word2Vec for item recommendation and the data science behind it. 

The demo data can be downloaded here: https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

import collections
import math
import os
import random
from tempfile import gettempdir
import zipfile

import numpy as np
from six.moves import urllib
from six.moves import xrange  # pylint: disable=redefined-builtin
import tensorflow as tf

import pickle
import pandas as pd

```


```python
tr = pd.read_csv( 'to_read.csv' )
b = pd.read_csv( 'books.csv' )
bt = tr.merge( b[[ 'book_id', 'title']], on = 'book_id' )
```


```python
bt.sample(10)
```


Make every user's to-read list as a sentence and feed it into word2vec.

Given a dataset large enough, it can find out similar books
