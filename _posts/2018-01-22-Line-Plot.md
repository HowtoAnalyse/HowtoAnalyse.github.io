## Visualization


```python
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

dates = []
for month in range(2, 12):
    dates.append(dt.datetime(year=2017, month=month, day=1))


df=pd.DataFrame({'x': dates, 'y1': np.random.randn(10), 'y3': np.random.randn(10)+range(11,21), 'y5': np.random.randn(10)+range(4,14)+(0,0,9,0,0,0,0,1,2,0), })
plt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid')
my_dpi=96
plt.figure(figsize=(960/my_dpi, 480/my_dpi), dpi=my_dpi)
 
# multiple line plot
for column in df.drop('x', axis=1):
   plt.plot(df['x'], df[column], marker='', color='grey', linewidth=1, alpha=0.4)
 

plt.plot(df['x'], df['y5'], marker='', color='orange', linewidth=4, alpha=0.7)

# num=0
# for i in df.values[9][1:]:
#    num+=1
#    name=list(df)[num]
#    if name != 'y5':
#       plt.text(0.000000000005, i, name, horizontalalignment='left', size='small', color='grey')

# And add a special annotation for the group we are interested in
# plt.text(10.2, df.y5.tail(1), 'Mr Orange', horizontalalignment='left', size='small', color='orange')

# Add titles
plt.title("Pageviews of Machine Learning posts vs other categories", loc='left', fontsize=12, fontweight=0, color='orange')
plt.xlabel("YearMonth")
plt.ylabel("Pageviews")

## Description

This graph shows the growth of the pageviews of howtoanalyse.github.io from February,2017 to December,2017. It is taken from Google Analytics.

There are eight graphs in the chart. Each graph deals with the pageviews of a category. The orange graph shows the pageviews on Machine Learning posts. In April,2017 there was an enourmous growth. In the following months the total growth went down to about 7 in June, 2017. From that time on the pageviews of Machine Learning posts has been gradually growing again although the natural increase slows down. So we can say that the growth of the pageviews in Machine Learning posts is based on Ads.
