I'm recently working on a text classification problem. The paper, Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification, is quite inspiring with many shining ideas worth sharing here.

In a recurrent convolutional neural network, a **bi-directional recurrent structure** is applied to capture contextual information as far as possible and a **max-pooling layer** to judge which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. 

By combining these two structures, it introduces considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks while maintaining the ability to determine discriminative phrases in a document. Additionaly, it exhibits a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is linearly correlated with the length of the text length.

I will later post my python code implementing this structure and evaluate its performance using Youtube comments data.
